# Financial Sales Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of financial sales data using Microsoft Excel. The primary objective was to transform raw data into a structured, interactive dashboard that provides insights into sales trends, profitability, and regional performance.

## Key Insights & Findings
* **Top Revenue Source:** The 'Government' segment is the most significant contributor to total sales.
* **Profitability Leaders:** Products like 'Paseo' show the highest profit margins despite varying sales volumes.
* **Growth Markets:** The North American region (USA & Canada) shows consistent month-over-month growth.
* **Efficiency:** High discount strategies drive volume but require optimization to maintain healthy profit margins.

## Features of the Dashboard
* **Data Cleaning:** Processed via **Power Query** to handle null values and standardize data types.
* **Dynamic Interactivity:** Integrated **Slicers** for filtering data by Country, Segment, and Time Period.
* **KPI Tracking:** High-level metrics for Sales, Profit, and Units Sold.
* **Visual Analysis:** Monthly trends and product-wise comparisons using Pivot Charts.

## Technical Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel** (Data Visualization & Dashboards)
* **Power Query** (ETL - Extract, Transform, Load)
* **Pivot Tables** (Data Aggregation)
